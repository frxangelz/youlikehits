YouLikeHits is a free social media directory network which helps you grow your social networking presence. With YouLikeHits you will get more exposure on the social networks you use!  It is a promotional tool that will help you grow your Twitter, VK, Pinterest, SoundCloud, Twitch, Websites and more. Getting started with YouLikeHits is very simple and completely free. you can get free points by liking, following, subscribing to other social media accounts from other youlikehits users. however, sometimes we feel tired and frustrated if we do it continuously manually one by one, this will take a lot of time and effort. that's why I tried to make you a chrome extension that will do that automatically, as we know, one of the benefits of chrome extensions is that it helps us to do simple tasks continuously.

*** YOU MUST USE ENGLISH LAYOUT FOR YOUR DUMMY SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT ***

*** YOU HAVE TO ALLOW POPUP FOR ADDMEFAST SITE IN CHROME/EDGE/OPERA SETTINGS !!! ***


use dummy account instead of main account to get points
- if you use instagram account to gain points, YOU HAVE TO LOGOUT AND LOGIN AGAIN (INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT RELOGIN)
